# Test Example 03
## Servo

Servos are generally noted as geared motors with capabiliteis to rotate 180 - in most cases 180 degrees some may vary depending.  The servo moves by way of pulses form the arduino.

There may not be too much to discuss here,  as it is fairly simple.  there is a 5v port and a digital pin and last ground,  feel free to uopdate the code as you desire.
