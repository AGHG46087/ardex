# Test Example 08
## Making a sounder sensor

A Microphone is a tranducer, that whioch converts energy from one form to another - in this case sound energy into electrical signals.  For all intents and purposes the opposite of a speaker.  In this specific example,  I used a electret condensor micrphone.  - a common pience of electronics comonly found in laptops, mobile phones and other devices.  

The microphone carries to parralel pates as in a capacitor a capaticance priniciple is applied.  In this case one plate is fixed and the other is movable.  The strikes the movalble diaphran plate thereby changing the capacitance between plates and in turn current flow.
