# Test Example 06
## Making note sounds with a passive buzzer 

This exercise will generate and play a C Major scale. each tone will have a duration of 0.5 seconds
The primary principle of a passive buzzers utilzes a Pulse Wave Modulation (PWM) to generate audio that essentially makes a physical change to the air movement to vibrate.  

## TODO:  Create another routine to generate a small song.
