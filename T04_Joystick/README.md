## Joystick

Well ever since the days of video games and remote control toys, cars, planes - joysticks are a cool way to add some control to the projects.  

We have to use analog Arduino pins to read the data from the X/Y pins, and a digital pin to read the button. The Key pin is connected to ground, when the joystick is pressed down, and is floating otherwise. 

Stable readings of the joystick there wil be a need to connect to a VCC witha  pull up resistor - Arduino digital pins can be used to accomodate
