# ardex

Contain some examples sketches for arduino.
The repository will be intended to add new example items and README will be set up later to document
* T01: RGB_LED - demonstration of a RGB led and sequncing.
* T02: Digital Inputs - demonstration of multiple momentary switches to control LED on/off.
* T03: Servo - demonstration of controlling a servo motor. good stuff if there is an interest robotics.
* T04: Joystick - demonstration of controlling movement. good stuff if there is an interest robotics or video games.
* T05: Multi RGB Driver - demonstration of multiple LEDS shift through the register and up and down.
* T06: Make sounds - demonstration of generating sounds with an active buzzer.
* T07: Passive Buzz Snd - demonstration of generating note sounds with an passive buzzer.
* T08: Sound Sensor - demonstration of Sound detection for digital and analog
* T09: Ultrasonic - Demonstration of a HC-SR04 untrasonc sensor to measure ddistance.
