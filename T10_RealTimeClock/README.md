# Test Example 10
## implementation of a real time clock 

In this example, we will use the DS3231 clock module to render a display of year,month, day, hour, minute, second and of course week.

This DS3231 contains a time keeping chip and also has a integrated battery and provides a means to keep the time even when the clock is unplugged.


**TODO: DS3231 repo: Submit a PR to the Github repo and updates the sample as in CPP the warning about dangling pointers occur.**
